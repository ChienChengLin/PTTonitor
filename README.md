# PTTonitor
> This is my graduation project in the college. The main purpose of this project is to build up a Query Platform of user accounts to find out whether there are some different accounts owned by a single person. By analyzing the data of logging IP address, user online time, high frequency words using in posts, and interactions between users, PTTonitor finally generates the visual graphics which provide an interactive way of Querying and Searching.
